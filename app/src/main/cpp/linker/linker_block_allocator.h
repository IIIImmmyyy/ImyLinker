/*
 * A simple allocator for the dynamic linker. An allocator allocates instances
 * of a single fixed-size type. Allocations are backed by page-sized private
 * anonymous mmaps.
 *
 * The differences between this allocator and BionicAllocator are:
 * 1. This allocator manages space more efficiently. BionicAllocator operates in
 *    power-of-two sized blocks up to 1k, when this implementation splits the
 *    page to aligned size of structure; For example for structures with size
 *    513 this allocator will use 516 (520 for lp64) bytes of data where
 *    generalized implementation is going to use 1024 sized blocks.
 *
 * 2. This allocator does not munmap allocated memory, where BionicAllocator does.
 *
 * 3. This allocator provides mprotect services to the user, where BionicAllocator
 *    always treats its memory as READ|WRITE.
